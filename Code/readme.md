This folder includes the source code that runs the program. It has different versions of the code but we are using the files in the newer version of the code.

It contains:

 	1. The main CSS file for styling the program
	
	2. The main HTML file that contains the layout of the program - this is saved in the public folder
	
	3. The main JS file that contains the functionality of the program - this is stored in the public folder

The code was done in node.js and run on the local host server. The instructions on how to run the code are as follows:

	1. to run code on a server go to the directory with all your node stuff (default C:\program files\node js)

	2. place main.html and server3.js and the public folder in that directory

	3. open cmd and navigate to that directory using cd C:\...
	
	4. then use comand (npm install express) and wait till it installs
	
	5. finally run the server by typing (node server3) in the command prompt
	
	6. go to your web browser and enter localhost:3000 

	7. you are now running the game on your browser
