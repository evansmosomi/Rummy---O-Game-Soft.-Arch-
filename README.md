# SOFE 2720 Final Project 

This project is a web-based prototype of the tile game Rummy-O. In this repository one can find 5 folders; Code, Design, Requirements, Use Cases, and Test cases. Each of these folders contain associated atrifacts that breakdown and show the development of the project from start to finish.  

## Table of Contents

* [Traceability Matrix]
* [Team Assessment Report]
* [Requirments folder](#Requirments)
  * [req1](#req)
* [Use Cases folder](#Usecase)
  * [usecase1](#use)
* [Design folder](#Design)
  * [des1](#des)
* [Code folder](#Code)
  * [code1](#co)
* [Test Cases folder](#testCase)
  * [test1](#test)








In this file you should give an overview of the software product and links to the different artifacts in your repository.
It is somewhat like a table of contents with the addition of a product overview.
This is the entry point for the grading of the project. 
If you can also have a link to the execution of the code that would be great but not a requirement.
This is possible by leveraging the GitHub Actions Node.js functionality (I am assuming that your project is leveraging Node.js)
